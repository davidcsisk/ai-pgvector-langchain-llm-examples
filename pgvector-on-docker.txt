# This docker container is useful if you are developing on Windows...pgvector extension is still experimental on the Windows platform
#
# This example gets the pgvector docker container, shows you how to run it, get a command line on the container,
# create a database for Langchain to use, and add the vector extension to that database.
# If you run this the way I've specified, you can then login to test like so:  psql -h localhost -U postgres usconstitution (password postgres)
# You will need to set an environment variable for the demo app to use...it should look like this:
# PGVECTOR_CONNECTION=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/usconstitution
# You must of course first install docker on your laptop for any of this to work

docker pull ankane/pgvector
docker images

# First time.  Create the directory for docker to map the db storage to...this prevents data from getting lost if the docker container is removed.
docker run --name pgvector -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d -p 5433:5432 -v C:\Users\david\OneDrive\Documents\AI_stuff\pgvector-docker-volume:/var/lib/postgresql/data ankane/pgvector

# Every subsequent time
docker start/stop pgvector

# Get a commandline on the container
docker exec -it pgvector /bin/bash
su - postgres
psql
create database usconstitution;
\q

# Login to new DB and add the vector extension in the new DB
psql usconstitution
create extension vector;
